The Presenter-Coordinator-VIPER architecture is a design pattern that is commonly used to build iOS apps. It is based on the VIPER architecture, which stands for View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, and Router.
The Presenter-Coordinator variation of VIPER adds an additional layer, the Coordinator, to handle navigation and flow control within the app.
The main components of the Presenter-Coordinator-VIPER architecture are:
View: This is the visual part of the app that the user interacts with. It is responsible for displaying information to the user and handling user input.
Interactor: This component is responsible for handling the business logic of the app. It communicates with the data store and the APIs to retrieve and update data.
Presenter: This component acts as a bridge between the View and Interactor. It receives user input from the View and sends it to the Interactor for processing. It also receives data from the Interactor and sends it to the View for display.
Entity: This component represents the data objects used by the app.
Router: This component is responsible for handling navigation and flow control within the app. It is responsible for creating and presenting new screens, and for passing data between screens.
Coordinator: This component is responsible for the flow of the application, it's like the Router, but with the main goal of not having the ViewControllers know about each other.
In a self-car care app, the View might display information about the car's current state, such as fuel level, tire pressure, and oil level. The Interactor might handle tasks such as calculating the remaining range of the car based on the fuel level, or sending a command to the car's onboard computer to check the tire pressure.
The Presenter would receive input from the user, such as a request to check the tire pressure, and pass it on to the Interactor. The Entity would represent the data objects used by the app, such as the car's current state and the user's preferences.
The Router would handle navigation between screens, such as moving from the main screen to a screen for checking tire pressure. The Coordinator would handle the flow of the application, such as showing a tutorial for first-time users, or showing a page for maintenance.
